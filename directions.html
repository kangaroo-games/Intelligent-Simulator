<h6>About Money</h6>
<p>The objective of the game is to have 10,000,000 money or passed that. Click the work button to gain money. Money is used to hire workers, libarians, professors, ect.</p>
<p>Workers, Libarians, Professors, Lawyers, Sales People, and Celebrities all give money per second. However Libarians are the only ones out of the group that give you IQ per second which is the same as the money they give you per second.</p>

<h6>About IQ</h6>
<p>IQ is used to buy special items, perks and other things that no ordinary person can do. These are powerful things to increase money flow, decrease prices and many more.</p>
<p>However this is a high working progress game with still many things that require money and/or IQ to be added.</p>
